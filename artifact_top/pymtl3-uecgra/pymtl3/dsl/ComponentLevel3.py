We add value wire/interface connections. Basically, all connected
value signal in the whole graph should have the same value of the unique
"net writer" written in an update block.
Then, the update block for a net is basically one writer writes to those
readers. Interface connections are handled separately, and they should
be revamped when adding method-based interfaces.
