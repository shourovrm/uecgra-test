UE-CGRA Benchmark on TinyRV2 Processor
-------------------------------------

Author : Peitian Pan

This directory contains the source files and build system of
the CGRA micro-benchmarks. This repo reuses mcppbs.
You can build native binary like this:

    make build
    ../configure
    make

You can also build binary for TinyRV2 as follows:

    make build-riscv
    ../configure --host=riscv32-unknown-elf
    make

The proc-sim top level directory includes an ELF simulator:

    cd $UCGRA_ROOT
    mkdir build-tinyrv2
    ../proc-sim/mcore-sim-elf --ncores 1 --single-cycle-mul \
    --stats <path-to-riscv32-elf-binary>

By default, the simulator translates the processor and dumps
VCD from Verilator.
